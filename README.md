# Sand Simulator

This is a simple "*particle*" simulator, meant to replicate colored Sand and Wood (the latter as a material not affected by gravity).

Built using p5.js. Based on [this tutorial](https://jason.today/falling-sand).

## Controls

The controls of the application are pretty straight forward:
- Pressing `Sand` will select the tool for spawning sand.
- Pressing `Wood` will select the tool for spawning sand.
- Pressing `Erase` will select the erase tool.
- Pressing `Clear All` will clear the whole canvas.
